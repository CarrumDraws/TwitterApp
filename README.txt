Issues:
    - How to check if access_token is valid
    - Should I check for token validity after every failed API call on dashboard?

Questions: 
    - Should I keep the loggedIn state in localStorage, so it persists?

Todo:

    - How to deal with people messing around with localStorage? Use a seperate DB?
    - URLSearchParams Not percent-encoding spaces correctly

    - Encode my data when saving it to localStorage?
    - Should organize my server routes better
